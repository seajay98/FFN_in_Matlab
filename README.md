# FFN_in_Matlab
A Feed Forward Neural Network implementation written completely in MATLAB (no toolboxes).

No, this is not as optimized as pytorch, but it works!
This was developed in 2022 as part of the author's Master's curriculum in Financial Mathematics at the University of Dayton.

The network is applied to pricing European options, and explores the practical impact of different activation functions (sigmoid and ReLU), learning rate, and Stochastic Gradient Descent batch size.

The code is in the /src directory and is fully described in the LaTeX pdf.
